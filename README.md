# Setup Instructions

The website is based on <http://jekyllrb.com/> Jekyll, based on Ruby.

## Environment setup

**Important**: This guide is oriented for Linux, Unix and Mac OS X 
  systems. For  Windows you are encouraged to use a Ruby bundle, such 
  as RubyInstaller for Windows <http://rubyinstaller.org/>. 


If you already have a Ruby environment configured, proceeed to the
next step.


There are two main methods to have a Ruby environment in your
system. Either using your system packaging tool or rvm. I recomend to
use rvm <http://rvm.io>, since it provides more flexibility when using mutiple Ruby
versions.

This guide will use rvm for Ruby environment setup.

Install RVM and Ruby:

`\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`

Follow screen instructions. Make sure you do 
`source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm` to have the Ruby rvm environment
loaded in your session. 


## Jekyll setup

Install Jekyll gem.
`gem install jekyll`

# Getting sources

Clone the git repository
`git clone https://github.com/cs-ucsp/cs-ucsp.git`

Start hacking!

# Project organization and contributing

The project uses the Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/> front-end
framework.

* _layouts/ - contains website layout (general template)
* css/ - contains custom and Bootstrap' CSS stylesheets
* fonts/ - contains webfonts
* img/ - contains images
* js/ - contains custom and Bootstrap' Javascript
* _posts/ - Ignore this directory by now :)
* _config.yml - Jekyll configuration

## Creating new pages / sections

To create a new page you will need to create a new Jekyll-compatible
HTML file. For instance, if you create a file named `newfile.html` the
content of such file will be shown in the URI
<http://cs.ucsp.edu.pe/newfile.html>. 

if you want to create a section or area, you will need to create a
directory and place at least a `index.html` Jekyll-compatible HTML
inside. For instance, if you want to create a section named
`publications`, create a `publications` directory. It will be shown in
the URI <http://cs.ucsp.edu.pe/publications/>

## Testing changes

To test your changes, run `jekyll serve`. It will launch a webserver
on <http://localhost:4000>. Enter that address in your browser and you
are set.

## Submitting changes

To submit your changes to the public repository, you can do a git pull
request. See this guide to learn how
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request>.
