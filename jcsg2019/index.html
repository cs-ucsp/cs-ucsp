									Serious Games are games with at least one characterizing goal in addition to the fun factor. Examples for characterizing
									goals represent behavior changes (healthy lifestyle, nutrition, environment-friendly mobility behavior) or an intended learning effect.
									Accordingly, application domains of Serious Games are settled in the fields of health (prevention, rehabilitation and therapy,
									exergames and cognitive training) and education, training and simulation, but there are also good examples for the fruitful use of
									Serious Games in the fields of marketing and advertisement, tourism and cultural heritage or Serious Games for creating awareness for
									societal relevant issues such as security, religion, climate and energy.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Joint Conference on Serious Games is fully dedicated to Serious Games and its interdisciplinary characteristics combining game
									concepts and game technologies with further concepts and technologies required in the different application domains.
								</p>
								<p>
									The conference will be held on November 11-15, in the historical city of Arequipa, Perú. Arequipa is placed in the
									Southern Coastal region of Peru just below the edge of the Altiplano at 2335 meters above sea level and surrounded
									by three impressive volcanoes.  Arequipa is also known as The White City (Ciudad Blanca) because its many colonial-era
									Spanish buildings built of “sillar”, a pearly white volcanic rock. The city is about an hour away by plane from Lima
									and about 35 minutes away of Cuzco by plane.
