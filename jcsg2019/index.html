									The IFIP International Conference on Entertainment Computation (IFIP-ICEC) is the longest lasting and prime
									scientific conference series in the area of Entertainment Computing. It brings together practitioners, researchers,
									artists, designers, and industry on the design, creation, development, use, application and evaluation of digital
									entertainment content and experience systems. The conference series is cross-disciplinary, and stretches over the
									domains of computer science, human-computer-interaction, content production, digital games, multimedia, media studies,
									art, and design. The conference series aims at presenting high quality scientific results spanning from theory to application,
									use-cases, experience, and demonstrations. We solicit papers, posters, art exhibits, interactive sessions, and demonstrations,
									as well as we are looking for tutorial and workshop proposal.
								</p>
								<p>
									The conference will be held on November 11-15, in the historical city of Arequipa, Perú. Arequipa is placed in the
									Southern Coastal region of Peru just below the edge of the Altiplano at 2335 meters above sea level and surrounded
									by three impressive volcanoes.  Arequipa is also known as The White City (Ciudad Blanca) because its many colonial-era
									Spanish buildings built of “sillar”, a pearly white volcanic rock. The city is about an hour away by plane from Lima
									and about 35 minutes away of Cuzco by plane.
