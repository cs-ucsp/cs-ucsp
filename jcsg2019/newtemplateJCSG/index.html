											<h1>Joint Conference on Serious Games</h1>
											<p>Arequipa, Perú, November 11-15th 2019</p>
										</header>
										<p>
										Serious Games are games with at least one characterizing goal in addition to the fun factor. Examples for characterizing
										goals represent behavior changes (healthy lifestyle, nutrition, environment-friendly mobility behavior) or an intended learning effect.
										Accordingly, application domains of Serious Games are settled in the fields of health (prevention, rehabilitation and therapy,
										exergames and cognitive training) and education, training and simulation, but there are also good examples for the fruitful use of
										Serious Games in the fields of marketing and advertisement, tourism and cultural heritage or Serious Games for creating awareness for
										societal relevant issues such as security, religion, climate and energy.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Joint Conference on Serious Games is fully dedicated to Serious Games and its interdisciplinary characteristics combining game
										concepts and game technologies with further concepts and technologies required in the different application domains.
									</p>
									<p>
										The conference will be held on November 11-15, in the historical city of Arequipa, Perú. Arequipa is placed in the
										Southern Coastal region of Peru just below the edge of the Altiplano at 2335 meters above sea level and surrounded
										by three impressive volcanoes.  Arequipa is also known as The White City (Ciudad Blanca) because its many colonial-era
										Spanish buildings built of “sillar”, a pearly white volcanic rock. The city is about an hour away by plane from Lima
										and about 35 minutes away of Cuzco by plane.
